## Overview Description

**BoardGameCafé** is a social networking application designed for board games enthusiasts that provides several functions
for taking information about it, staying up-to-date on people's opinions about board games based on their own experiences,
and much more.

* **Non-registered Users** can only browse in read-only mode the contents of the application without the ability to perform
actions that in any way lead to possible undesirable consequences for the purpose of respecting the content uploaded by registered users.

* **Registered Users** can browse among a large number of Board Games with the possibility to read their specifications,
write a review and give a rating, create posts in which a topic related to a board game can be covered and moreover
they can also interact with other users by following them and commenting on their posts.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*N.B.*
Users who do not comply with the social network rules may incur a status change within the application, more precisely
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;they may be "*Banned*" by the admin and this entails a drastic deletion of the user profile and
all content attached to it &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;irreversibly.

* **Admins** can manage Users, Board Games, Post, Comment and Reviews with special privileges.
They also have access to the usage analytics of the application and Ban Users if needed.
